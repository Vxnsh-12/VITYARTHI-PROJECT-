[SLEEPGUARD PROJECT]
PROBLEM STATEMENT: ROAD ACCIDENTS ARE A MAJOR CAUSE OF DEATHS IN INDIA ,DRIVERS OFTEN SUCCUMB TO FATIGUE WHICH RESULTS IN UNCONTROLABLE 
                  MOMENTS .
                  # There is a significant need for an accessible, low-cost, and active intervention system that can detect the physical
                  signs of fatigue in real-time and alert the driver immediately to prevent collisions.


SCOPE OF THE PROJECT: SleepGuard is a computer-vision-based software application designed to run on standard laptop hardware or embedded
                     systems equipped with a webcam.
                     Real-time Monitoring: Continuous analysis of the driver's head posture using a standard webcam.

A) Active Alerting: Immediate audio-visual alarms triggered by detected fatigue events.

B) Forensic Logging: Automated local storage of incident evidence (photos and logs) for post-event analysis.

C) Offline Operation: Fully functional without an internet connection, ensuring reliability in remote areas.


TARGET USERS : 
A) Truck Drivers: Individuals driving for extended periods who are at high risk of fatigue.

b)Logistic Managers: Logistics companies seeking to monitor driver safety and insure accountability through forensic logs.

C) Night-Shift Workers: Taxi drivers or workers returning home late who are prone to drowsy driving.


HIGH LEVEL FEATURES: 
A) Gamified Fatigue Score: A visual "Health Bar" (0-100) that provides intuitive, real-time feedback on driver alertness levels using head/posture calibiration. 

B) Adaptive Calibration: A smart initialization process that learns the specific driver's height and seating position in 3 seconds, eliminating the need for manual configuration.

C) Evidence Collection: An automated forensic system that captures timestamped evidence (photos and text logs) whenever a critical fatigue event occurs.

D) Heads-Up Display (HUD): A transparent video overlay that displays system status, low-light warnings, and tracking diagnostics directly on the video feed.
